# python-ml-home-price-estimator

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project that demonstrates the fundamentals of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
The project estimates residential home prices based on square footage using a neural network built from scratch with NumPy, without relying on high-level ML libraries.

The goal of this repo is to showcase introductory machine-learning concepts in a clean, well-organized portfolio format that is easy to review for instructors, recruiters, and future employers.

## 📁 Project Files

### Everett_HomeValuator_Module_3.py
Home Price Estimator using an Artificial Neural Network

Uses a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer to learn pricing trends from example home data.

Includes:
- Data normalization
- Custom sigmoid activation function
- Manual backpropagation and gradient descent
- Training output showing predicted vs actual prices
- Interactive user input for estimating unknown home prices
